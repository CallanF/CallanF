# Proposal
I want to make something unique, but also something that is realistically achievable. Because of my affinity for video games, I would prefer for this to be what I make.

Because of this criteria, I plan on making an RPG. RPGs are largely based on math, and as long as I am careful enough about how I use states, I can probably figure out battles and overworld pretty quickly.
The uniqueness factor will be in the presentation and intuitiveness of the game; I will have the UI be very sharp and easy to use, and possibly give it unique mechanics that make it more interesting.

## Need to Have List
- Start Screen
- Menus
- Overworld System
- Battle System
- Stats
- Items and Gear
- Multiple party members
- One boss
